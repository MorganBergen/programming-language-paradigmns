deliverable is as follows
- tabbed panels are widely used in UI design
- they allow you to select an interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs "sticking out" above an element
- in this assignmet you must implement a simple tabbed interface using JavaScript & HTML
- write a function, asTabs that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface showing the child elemnts of that node
- it should insert a list of <button> elements at the top of the node, one for each child element, containing text retrieved from the data-tabnamed attribute of the child
    - all but one of the original children should be hidden



Document Object Model

JavaScript program may inspect and interfere with the document that the browser is displaying through a data strcuture
called the Document Object Model (DOM).
The DOM is a cross-platform and language independent interface that treats an HTML documemt as a tree structure.
The tree consists of element (i.e. HTML tag), text, and comment nodes.


The data structure the brower uese to represent the document follows the following shape.
- for each box, there is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents
and which boxes and text it contains.
- This representation is called the Document Object Model, or DOM for short
- The javascript blobal binding, document, gives us access to these objects.
- Its documentElement property refers to the object representing the <html> tag.
- Since every HTML document has a head and a body it also has a head and body properties, pointing at those elements
