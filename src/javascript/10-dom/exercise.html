    /* 1. Describe what the function byTagName does: The function byTagName takes a node
        and a tag name as arguments and returns an array of all descendant elements with the given tag name. It does this by
        calling the explore function, which recursively calls itself on each child node of the node passed to byTagName. If
        the child node is an element node and has the same tag name as the one passed to byTagName, it is added to the array
        of found elements. 
        
        2. Describe what the function explore does: The function explore takes a node as an argument and
        pushes all the elements with the given tag name to the found array. It does this by looping through the child nodes
        of the node passed to explore. If the child node is an element node and has the same tag name as the one passed to
        byTagName, it is added to the array of found elements. If the child node is an element node, explore is called on
        it.

    // 3. What is the output of the following code? Why?

    console.log(byTagName(document.body, "h1").length);
    console.log(byTagName(document.body, "span").length);
    let para = document.querySelector("p");
    console.log(byTagName(para, "span").length);


    /*

    The output of this code will be Heading with a span element.  A paragraph with one, two spans.
