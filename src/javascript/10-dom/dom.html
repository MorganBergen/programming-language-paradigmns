    Document Object Model

    JavaScript program may inspect and interfere with the document that the browser is displaying through a data strcuture called the Document Object Model (DOM).
    The DOM is a cross-platform and language independent interface that treats an HTML documemt as a tree structure.  
    The tree consists of element (i.e. HTML tag), text, and comment nodes.
    

    The data structure the brower uese to represent the document follows the following shape.
    - for each box, there is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which boxes and text it contains.
    - This representation is called the Document Object Model, or DOM for short
    - The javascript blobal binding, document, gives us access to these objects.
    - Its documentElement property refers to the object representing the <html> tag.
    - Since every HTML document has a head and a body it also has a head and body properties, pointing at those elements
