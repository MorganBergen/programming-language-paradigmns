<!--
    purpose of this canvas.html is to write a canvas script that draws this quadrature curve with a control point of (60, 10)

    https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_beziercurveto.asp

    quadratic curves are paths that may also contain curved lives
    the quadraticCurveTo() method draws a quadratic curve to a destination point.  
    
    To determine the curvature of the line, the method is given a
    - Control Point - control points are the points that determine the curvature of the line
    - Destination Point (x2, y2) - will be a straight line if the control point is the same as the destination point

    in computer graphics, a distinction is often made between vector graphics and bitmap graphics

    vector graphics is what we have been doing so far
    specifying a picture by giving a logical description of shapes

    bitmap graphics is a picture that is specified by a grid of pixels
